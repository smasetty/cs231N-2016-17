# cs231n

This repository is a placeholder for all assignments and other artifacts 
developed as part of Stanford's deep learning course. 

The Name of the course is: CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition
Course Material and assignments are from the Winter 2016-2017 semester.

All 3 assignments are completed.

Armed with the knowledged and the intuitions gained on [C/R]NNs with this course,
I am looking to work on a full scale deep learning project. I will update this
space with more details soon.

I also wish to use this repo to save the notes/links/papers and other resources
which I think would be useful in the long run.
